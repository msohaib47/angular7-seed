"# angular7-seed" 

Angular7 seed repository to quickly start project, specially if you are on a slow connection of behind firewall that might be blocking some or all or npm packages.

Two options...

1- Download zip file and unpack in a folder and you are ready to go. This will be faster to download but will take some time to extract files.

2- Clone repository. This will take longer to clone, but once that is complete, you are ready.
